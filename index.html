        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>COLLEGE NEST was founded by a first-generation college student who recognizes the challenges and isolation that can accompany the journey of navigating higher education.</p>
        <p>Our mission is to provide a comprehensive site that supports individuals in navigating all facets of higher education, from the college or university application process to post-graduate and professional programs. We know that there are thousands of resources available online, but filtering through the ones that are actually useful can be a tedious task. Our goal is to help you save time by highlighting resources that are both free and helpful.</p>
