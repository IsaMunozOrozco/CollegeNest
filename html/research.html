        <h2>The Research Process</h2>
        <p>By definition research is "the systematic investigation into and study of materials and sources in order to establish facts and reach new conclusions" (Oxford Languages). In other words, it is a rigiourous procedure for how we understand the world, whether from a micro (e.g., atomic, microbial, etc.) or macro (e.g., whole-body, societal) level. The <a href="https://www.nih.gov/about-nih/what-we-do/science-health-public-trust/perspectives/explaining-how-research-works">National Institute of Health </a> has a great article and inforgraphic, but we'll try and explain it furthur here.</p>
        <p>The research procedure can generally be explained in a few steps but you must know that the process itself involves multiple steps and is an iterative process. It is not a linear path. The exact steps also differ based on the lens in which you approach your topic, whether you are using primary or secondary data, among other factors. For instance, two scientist can approach the same problem or phenomenon with different approaches.</p><br>
